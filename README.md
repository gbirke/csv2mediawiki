csv2mediawiki
=============

This script converts CSV data to MediaWiki tables. 

This can be useful when using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), which does not support CSV as an input format.

The program uses input and output streams throughout so that the content does not have to be kept in memory.

## Installation

```
$ composer install
```

Usage examples
--------------
All examples assume that you are in the csv2mediawiki directory

### Simple usage - HTML snippet

```bash
$ ./csv2mediawiki myfile.csv | pandoc -f mediawiki -t html -o myfile.html
```

This will just output an HTML snippet file with just the HTML code for the table.

### HTML page

```bash
$ ./csv2mediawiki myfile.csv | pandoc -f mediawiki -t html -o myfile.html -s -c style.css
```

This will output a standalone HTML file with header and body. Further author and title information could be provided with more command line arguments.

### Watch folder for CSV files and convert them automatically
Install the [inotify-tools][2] first, then run the `watch_folder.sh` shell script:

```bash
$ ./watch_folder.sh input_folder output_folder
```

Whenever a file is written in input_folder, the command from the HTML page section is run. The resulting file name is the CDV file name with an added `.html` suffix. It will be written in the `output` folder.

Possible extensions
-------------------
- Expose different CSV formats (semicolon-delimited, tab-delimited) as command line parameters.
- This script does not need to be limited to CSV files. Using the [PHPExcel][1] library the script could be used to make more table formats accessible to the pandoc converter
